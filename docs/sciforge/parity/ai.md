# Parity spec: AI apps building in SciForge (brief home-cloud-ai.md, milestone M3)

An AI app Luca chats with (Claude Desktop, Gemini CLI, Claude Code, Codex...) gets SciForge's
tools through MCP (the Model Context Protocol) and builds in the open design while he
watches. Fusion has an AI assistant of its own but no connector for outside AI apps: this is
**beyond Fusion**; the design steps are the same code as SciForge's dialogs.

Implemented in `src/Mod/SciForge/sciforge/`:
- `ai/tools_core.py`: the 16 tools (get_design, screenshot, measure, create_sketch, extrude,
  revolve, fillet, chamfer, hole, pattern, shell, set_parameter, undo, redo, save, export),
  their JSON Schemas and descriptions for the model, the checks of their arguments (plain
  sentences: "radius must be a number above 0"), and how each becomes design steps.
- `ai/ops/`: the design steps (milestone M0: the golden models' code, so 434 reference parts
  prove what an AI builds).
- `ai/mcp_core.py`, `ai/sciforge_mcp.py`: the MCP server an AI app starts (stdio; MCP
  versions 2025-11-25, 2025-06-18, 2025-03-26, 2024-11-05). It runs with FreeCAD's own
  Python on Windows (python3 elsewhere), imports no FreeCAD, and passes each call to:
- `ai/bridge_core.py`, `ai/bridge.py`: the bridge inside SciForge: 127.0.0.1 only, a random
  port and key in `<user data>/SciForge/ai/bridge.json`; calls run on SciForge's own thread.
- `ai/installers.py`, `ai_ui.py`: Add an AI (Claude Desktop, Gemini CLI, a Claude Desktop
  extension `.mcpb`, the command line for other apps), the AI activity panel, Home's card.

Status: **built and tested with the real MCP server speaking to SciForge (scenario
`ai_bridge`, 43 checks); not yet tried with Claude Desktop or Gemini CLI on Windows.**

Tests: scenario `ai_bridge.py` (9 paths: the server starts and lists the tools, AI control
off by default, switched on and the first call asks, the 40 x 30 x 10 box with 3 mm rounded
edges in three calls (each one Undo step), get_design and a PNG screenshot, refused while a
command dialog is open, the activity panel and Undo last AI step, Stop AI control, Add an AI
for Gemini CLI and the Claude extension); unit tests `test_ai_tools_core.py`,
`test_ai_mcp_core.py`, `test_ai_bridge_core.py`, `test_ai_mcp_server.py` (the real server
against a fake bridge), `test_ai_installers.py`, `test_ai_ops_layout.py`.

## Behaviour

| What | SciForge |
|---|---|
| Off unless switched on | Preferences > AI > **Allow AI apps to control SciForge** (off). Off: nothing listens; the AI app's calls answer "SciForge is not running, or 'Allow AI apps to control SciForge' is off". |
| Add an AI | Home's **+ Add an AI**, File > **Add an AI App**: Claude Desktop (**Set up** adds SciForge to its settings file, a backup kept; quit and restart Claude Desktop), **Install as Claude extension...** (a `.mcpb` file opened with Claude Desktop), Gemini CLI (Set up; `/mcp` lists it), another app (the command line to copy). Setting one up switches AI control on. **Remove** takes SciForge out again (backup kept). A settings file that is not valid JSON is never touched. |
| The first call of a session | SciForge asks: "An AI app wants to control SciForge... Allow it for this session?" **Allow** / **Deny** (Deny is the default button). Denied: every call of the session is refused, in words. |
| Building | Each design-changing call is **one Undo step** named after it ("AI: Extrude 10 mm", "AI: Fillet 3 mm"), in the timeline like a step made by hand, built with the dialogs' code. A new step gets a readable id (Sketch1, Extrude1, Fillet1) the AI uses in later calls. A call that fails changes nothing and answers why ("extrude 'Extrude2': no sketch area contains [5, 5]"). With no design open, the first step starts one. |
| Seeing | **get_design**: bodies (volume, bounding box), the timeline with ids, parameters, sketches and their closed areas. **screenshot**: a PNG of the view (iso, front, top...) the AI looks at. **measure**: distance and angle between two picks. |
| Busy | While a command dialog, a sketch or a question is open in SciForge, changing calls answer "SciForge is busy: ... Finish or cancel it first." |
| Files | **save** saves the design (a version) or to a path; **export** STEP / STL / 3MF. Writing over an existing file always asks the person (Allow / Deny). There is no tool that runs code. |
| AI activity | A panel (right) lists every call with its answer, newest first, errors in red; **Undo last AI step** (only when the newest step is the AI's) and **Stop AI control** (switches the option off at once). Home's card shows AI control on / off, the apps set up and when it was last used. |
| Security | The bridge listens on 127.0.0.1 only; every call carries the random key from bridge.json (owner-only file), compared in constant time; a request from a web page (an Origin header) is refused; keys are never logged. |

## To check on a real PC (Windows, Luca)

1. File > Add an AI App > Claude Desktop > Set up; restart Claude Desktop; ask "make me a
   40 x 30 x 10 box with 3 mm rounded edges": SciForge asks once, the box appears, three
   steps in the timeline, Undo removes them one by one.
2. The same with Install as Claude extension.
3. Gemini CLI: Set up, `/mcp` lists sciforge.
4. The screenshot tool's picture shows the part (in the sandbox, without a graphics card,
   the off-screen picture left an empty frame on the 3D view: look whether it does on a PC).

## M4: the chat panel inside SciForge

The same 16 tools, but the person chats inside SciForge with their own API key: no other app
needed. Fusion's own assistant is Autodesk's; here the person picks the AI.

Implemented in `src/Mod/SciForge/sciforge/`:
- `ai/providers/`: one adapter per API (Anthropic Messages, OpenAI Responses, Google Gemini,
  any OpenAI-compatible server such as Ollama or LM Studio), each with its one default model
  and its models list from the provider's models endpoint.
- `ai/chat_core.py`: the conversation loop (the model asks for tools, SciForge answers,
  repeat until the model answers in words; at most 25 requests per message; Stop).
- `secrets_store.py`: keys kept for this user (Windows: DPAPI, encrypted for the Windows
  account; macOS Keychain; Linux Secret Service or a file only the owner can read).
- `ai/chat_ui.py`: the panel (right dock). File > **AI Chat**, Home's **Open chat panel**.

| What | SciForge |
|---|---|
| Pick the AI | Claude (Anthropic), ChatGPT (OpenAI), Gemini (Google), Local or other (an address such as `http://localhost:11434/v1`; **List** asks the server for its models). |
| Key | Pasted once, **Save key** keeps it (encrypted on Windows); never written to the log or the Report view. A key the provider refuses is said in words ("the key was not accepted"). |
| Cost and privacy | The panel says plainly: API use is billed by the provider per use, separately from a chat subscription; the design's data and screenshots go to that provider; the local option is free and private. |
| Building | Every step the AI makes is one Undo step, as with AI apps. No "Allow this AI app?" question: the person typing is the one asking. The rest of the bridge's rules hold (busy while a dialog is open, overwriting a file asks). |
| Stop | Stops after the current step; the steps made stay in the timeline. |
| Answers | Shown whole when they arrive (not streamed word by word yet). |

Tests: scenario `ai_chat.py` (a fake OpenAI-compatible server inside the test: List shows
its model, "make a 40 x 30 x 10 box" builds the box in two Undo steps, a model that never
stops is stopped with Stop, a Claude key saved, read back, never logged, removed); unit tests
`test_ai_providers.py` (each adapter against recorded answers), `test_ai_chat_core.py`
(the loop with a scripted model), `test_secrets_store.py`.

Not verified: the OpenAI default model name (`providers/openai.py`) and Gemini's exact
error words; the real services were not called from the sandbox.

### To check on a real PC (M4)

1. File > AI Chat > Claude, paste an Anthropic API key, Save key, ask for the 40 x 30 x 10
   box with 3 mm rounded edges: the steps appear, Undo removes them one by one.
2. The same with ChatGPT and Gemini keys, and with Ollama (`ollama pull qwen3:8b`, then
   Local or other, `http://localhost:11434/v1`, List).

## The AI panel (2026-10-19, Luca: reachable in a design, a clear X, a switch, the AIs added)

One panel at the right for everything AI (`sciforge/ai_panel_ui.py`): **UTILITIES > AI**
(its own icon; a second click closes it), File > AI Panel, Home's **Open AI panel**.

| What | SciForge |
|---|---|
| Close | Its title bar: **AI** and an **X** (drawn like the browser's). |
| AI control | A switch at the top: the same option as Preferences > AI. It replaces the Stop AI control button. Home has the same switch. |
| Your AIs | The AI apps set up (Claude Desktop, Gemini CLI) and the chat AIs with a key kept (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini) or a local model's address, each with its badge: SciForge's own coloured square with letters (Cl, Ge, GPT, Lo), never a company's logo. As many as there are (the list scrolls). Double-click: a chat AI opens the Chat tab with it chosen; an app opens Add an AI on it. **+ Add an AI** under the list. Home lists the same AIs. |
| Chat, Activity | Two tabs: the chat panel and the activity list (Undo last AI step). File > AI Chat and AI Activity open the panel on their tab. A call from an AI app opens the panel on Activity when it was closed. |

Tests: scenario `ai_panel.py` (UTILITIES > AI opens and closes it, the X, the switch and
Home's, two chat keys listed with badges on the panel and Home, double-click picks Claude,
Home closes the browser and opens Preferences); `ai_bridge.py` Path 8 turns AI control off
with the switch.

## Documentation for AI models (2026-10-21, Luca: "give all the tools possible, with absolutely all the documentation available")

An AI that can read more about SciForge works better in it. Fusion has help pages for people;
SciForge also has documentation written for AI models, searchable by them, and checked
against the code: **beyond Fusion**.

Implemented in `src/Mod/SciForge/`:
- `docs/ai/`: the handbook (what SciForge is, Fusion's ideas mapped to it, coordinates and
  units, the timeline and history marker, bodies, components and joints, ids, how tool calls
  become undo steps, a good way to work), sketches, selectors (with a cookbook), checking,
  troubleshooting (the real failure messages and how to recover), 12 recipes (bracket,
  enclosure with lid, shaft with keyway, gear pair, flange with bolt pattern, threaded
  fastener, snap-fit, sheet-like part, revolved knob, lofted handle, surface patch,
  parametric plate), and generated pages: `tools.md`, one `reference/<tool>.md` per tool,
  `examples/golden-models.md` and a copy of the person's documents under `user/`.
- `sciforge/ai/docs_core.py`: the library (BM25 search over every section, sections by
  anchor, pages, examples, the system prompt's index, the single-file export);
  `sciforge/ai/tool_docs.py` writes the generated pages; `tools/sciforge/make_ai_docs.py`
  runs it.
- Tools `docs_search`, `docs_read`, `examples_search` (the MCP server answers them itself, so
  they work while SciForge is closed); MCP resources `sciforge://docs/<path>[#anchor]`,
  `sciforge://examples/golden/<id>`, `sciforge://handbook` (all in one file; `/compact`,
  `/full`); the chat panel's system prompt has a short index of the documents.
- One file for AI apps that load files: **+ Add an AI > Save AI handbook...**,
  `sciforge-cli docs export FILE [--compact | --full]`.

| What | SciForge |
|---|---|
| Accurate | Every tool call in every document is run in real FreeCAD by the tests (`SciForgeTests/headless/docs_runner.py`, 330+ calls), each with what its answer must contain; every tool's reference example answer is recorded in FreeCAD and checked again on every run; a unit test fails when a generated page is out of date or a `sciforge://` link (anchor included) is broken. |
| Searchable | `docs_search` "cut does nothing" finds the troubleshooting section; the unit tests ask 25 realistic questions and check the right page is in the first three answers. |
| Complete | Every tool has a page with every argument (type, unit, default, limits), the answer, the errors and a complete example with its real answer; the person's own documentation is included. |

Fixed on the way (found by writing the documentation): Move/Copy rotate ignored `pivot`
(golden `bodies_move_rotate_pivot`); bounding boxes of free-form bodies were too big (lofts,
patches: FreeCAD's quick box includes the control points); a surface step that failed did
not say why; a surface body reported a volume; deleting a parameter used by another
parameter's formula was allowed (the formula broke); a step that changed nothing (a cut from
the top face without flip, a shell thicker than the part) answered "Done" with no warning.

Tests: `test_ai_docs_library.py`, `test_ai_docs_contract.py` (unit); the docs runner
(`run_tests.sh --only headless / base`); scenario `ai_docs_gui` (the reference examples that
need the window, the docs tools through the bridge, Save AI handbook... with a real click).
