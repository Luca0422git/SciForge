# SciForge memory and progress log

This file is the project's memory across work sessions. **Read it first, every session**, then
`docs/sciforge/feature-outline.md` (the spec). Update it at the end of every session: what was
done, what was learned, what is next. Newest session goes at the top of the log.

## Where things live

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| The spec (source of truth for scope) | `docs/sciforge/feature-outline.md` |
| This memory / progress log | `MEMORY.md` |
| SciForge's own module (workbench, timeline, search, ...) | `src/Mod/SciForge/` |
| Golden-model benchmark suite (step lists + runner) | `src/Mod/SciForge/SciForgeTests/golden/` |
| Every change to FreeCAD's own code (tagged `SCIFORGE:`) | `docs/sciforge/core-patches.md` |
| CI workflows (SciForge's own) | `.github/workflows/sciforge-*.yml` |
| Tooling scripts for CI / local runs | `tools/sciforge/` |
| Original "Forge" v0.1 prototype, kept verbatim for history | `prototype/forge-freecad/` |
| Upstream FreeCAD source | everything else (the fork base is tag `1.1.4`) |

## Fixed facts

- **Fork base:** FreeCAD tag `1.1.4` (commit `4fd3bf320d`), full upstream history kept so future
  FreeCAD releases can be merged (`git remote add upstream https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD.git`,
  then `git fetch upstream refs/tags/1.1.X:refs/tags/1.1.X` and merge the tag).
- **Repo:** `github.com/Luca0422git/SciForge`, **private**. Private repos get a limited monthly
  budget of GitHub Actions minutes (Windows minutes count double), so full C++ builds run only
  when started by hand (Actions tab → "SciForge build" → Run workflow). Cheap tests run on
  every push.
- **History is 2.4 GB**: GitHub rejects a single push over 2 GB, so the initial import was
  pushed in 5 fast-forward stages. Normal pushes are small and unaffected.
- **License:** LGPL-2.1-or-later (inherited from FreeCAD). Keep FreeCAD copyright notices.
- **Owner:** Luca, a beginner at software engineering who tests, not codes. Explain plainly. Primary
  platform Windows 10/11, then Linux. No macOS.
- **Sandbox can run real FreeCAD**: the official FreeCAD 1.1.4 Linux AppImage downloads and runs
  headless (`freecadcmd`) *and* with a GUI on a virtual screen (`xvfb-run`). Use
  `tools/sciforge/get_freecad.sh` to fetch it. The 3D view renders blank under xvfb (no GPU),
  but widgets, toolbars, commands and geometry all work, and screenshots of the window work.

## Decisions log

| Date | Decision | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-10-09 | Fork at 1.1.4 with full history (not a flat copy) | Makes merging future FreeCAD releases a normal `git merge` |
| 2026-10-09 | Removed FreeCAD-org automation workflows (translations, stale bot, backport, labeler, CodeQL, scorecards, Fedora nightly, weekly release, dependabot); `CI_master.yml` made manual-only | They serve FreeCAD's organization, fail or waste minutes here; a weekly release cron would have run on our default branch |
| 2026-10-09 | SciForge module lives at `src/Mod/SciForge` and is installed by the normal CMake build | Ships inside every SciForge build; no separate add-on install step |
| 2026-10-09 | Golden models are JSON step lists run by a small interpreter in real FreeCAD | Same file runs in CI (headless) and can later be compared with Fusion reference metrics |
| 2026-10-09 | Until the branding pass lands, CI's Windows build ships the portable 7z only, no installer | The FreeCAD NSIS installer would install over / clash with a real FreeCAD install |

## Status by phase (outline section 10)

### Phase 0: Foundations (in progress)

- [x] Fork FreeCAD 1.1.4 into the SciForge repo (full history)
- [x] Commit outline + Forge prototype
- [x] Disable upstream automation that does not apply
- [x] First real run of the prototype in FreeCAD 1.1.4 (GUI, under xvfb): found and fixed 2 bugs
- [x] SciForge module seeded from the prototype at `src/Mod/SciForge` (renamed, `[SciForge]` logs),
      built by CMake (`BUILD_SCIFORGE`, core patch #3)
- [x] Golden-model harness + 32 models with hand-derived expectations (31 pass on stock 1.1.4,
      1 = upstream bug fixed by core patch #4)
- [x] GUI smoke test in real FreeCAD under xvfb (14 checks, screenshot)
- [x] `tools/sciforge/run_tests.sh` runs all of it with one command
- [x] CI `sciforge-tests.yml`: unit + golden + GUI smoke on every push (against stock FreeCAD)
- [x] First `sciforge-tests.yml` run on GitHub is green (2026-10-09)
- [x] CI `sciforge-build.yml` written (manual): Windows portable 7z + Linux AppImage, then
      golden models run on the built SciForge
- [ ] First `sciforge-build.yml` run succeeds (never run yet: expect fixes; it is hours long)
- [ ] First CI build downloaded and launched by Luca on Windows
- [ ] Branding pass: app name, icons, user-data folder, installer (side by side with FreeCAD)
- [ ] Parity capture: Luca records Fusion workflows; behavior specs written + signed off
- [ ] Spike 9.1: Press/Pull feasibility report (OCC offset / local ops), with benchmark
- [ ] Spike 9.2: Fillet robustness benchmark + feasibility report
- [ ] Answers to the open questions in outline section 12

### Phase 1+ : not started

## Known issues / findings

- Prototype bug (fixed in `src/Mod/SciForge`): `package.xml` lacked `<subdirectory>./</subdirectory>`,
  so FreeCAD 1.1 looked for `Forge/InitGui.py` and silently skipped the add-on. It would never have
  appeared on Luca's machine.
- Prototype bug (fixed): `Sketcher_External` no longer exists in 1.1. It is now
  `Sketcher_Projection` + `Sketcher_Intersection` (matches Fusion's Project / Intersect split).
- **Upstream bug (core patch #4):** `LinearPattern.Spacings2` defaults to `[0.0]`, so 2-direction
  linear patterns in Spacing mode stack row 2 on row 1. Fixed in C++ but **not yet compiled**:
  the first `sciforge-build.yml` run verifies it (golden `plate_hole_grid` must PASS there).
  Worth reporting upstream.
- FreeCAD API: `body.newObject()` does not move `Body.Tip` for pattern/mirror features (the GUI
  commands do it separately). The golden builder sets Tip explicitly. Anything SciForge builds
  from Python must do the same.
- Parity item: FreeCAD leaves split seam faces unless `Refine = True`; Fusion never shows them.
  SciForge features should default to refined. Golden models assume refined face counts.
- Sketch on XZ extrudes toward -Y in FreeCAD. Fusion's plane orientation differs (Y-up vs Z-up
  setting): needs a parity decision during the sketch behavior spec.
- OCC results matched the hand formulas for corner fillets (two fillets meeting a sharp edge),
  vertex blends (all-edge rounded box), chamfer corners, countersinks and shells: a good sign
  for 9.2, but these are easy cases. The real fillet benchmark (100+ hard cases) is still to do.
- Fusion semantics still unknown (need parity capture before adding golden models): taper
  angle sign, chamfer two-distance side assignment, "intersect" and "new body" behavior.

## Questions waiting for Luca

(See outline section 12. Also:)
- OK to make the repo public at some point? Public repos get unlimited free Actions minutes,
  which matters a lot for C++ builds. Otherwise a self-hosted runner on the NAS is the route.

## Session log

### 2026-10-09: Session 1
- Forked FreeCAD 1.1.4 (latest stable) into the repo with full history, pushed in stages.
- Added outline and prototype verbatim; removed FreeCAD-org automation workflows.
- Got real FreeCAD 1.1.4 running in the sandbox (headless + GUI via xvfb).
- Ran the prototype for the first time in real FreeCAD; fixed 2 bugs (see Known issues).
- Created `src/Mod/SciForge` from the prototype (renamed), wired into CMake.
- Built the golden-model harness (schema, selectors, builder, runner) and 32 models;
  found and patched an upstream FreeCAD bug with it.
- Added GUI smoke test, `tools/sciforge/*.sh`, CI workflows, docs (`docs/sciforge/`).

## Next steps (in order)

1. Ask Luca to start `SciForge build` (windows) once; fix the build workflow until it produces
   a portable 7z, and check golden `plate_hole_grid` PASSES on the built SciForge (patch #4).
2. Luca launches the portable build on Windows and reports (Report view + Diagnostics).
3. Get answers to outline section 12 + parity captures of Luca's Fusion workflows (2.4).
4. Spike 9.1 (Press/Pull): research OCC `BRepOffsetAPI_MakeOffsetShape`, `LocOpe`,
   `BRepAlgoAPI_Defeaturing`, `BRepOffset_MakeSimpleOffset`, face replacement; write
   feasibility report + first 40 Press/Pull golden cases (needs new ops in the builder).
5. Spike 9.2 (Fillets): 100+ case benchmark from real part workflows, success-rate metric.
6. Branding pass (app name, icons, user-data folder, installer) so CI can ship an installer.
7. Grow golden models toward 100 (gear, bottle loft+shell, sweep pipe, snap-fit, hinge, threads)
   once the builder supports loft/sweep/thread.
